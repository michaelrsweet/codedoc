============

Codedoc is a general-purpose utility which scans HTML, markdown, C, and C++
source files to produce EPUB, HTML, and man page documentation that can be read
by humans.  Unlike popular C/C++ documentation generators like Doxygen or
Javadoc, Codedoc uses in-line comments rather than comment headers, allowing for
more "natural" code documentation.  Additional markdown documentation content
can be included to make the generated documentation even more useful and
complete.

Codedoc was originally bundled with the Mini-XML library as the `mxmldoc`
utility.


Building Codedoc
----------------

Codedoc comes with the usual configure script and makefile that will work on
most Linux/UNIX systems and macOS.  Prerequisites include ZLIB 1.1 or later and
Mini-XML 4.x.

Run the following commands to build the software:

    ./configure
    make

The default install prefix is `/usr/local`, which can be overridden using the
`--prefix` option:

    ./configure --prefix=/some/other/directory
    make


Installing Codedoc
------------------

To install the software, run:

    sudo make install


Documentation
-------------

The codedoc man page provides documentation on how to use it.  Further
documentation can be found in the file "DOCUMENTATION.md" and the generated
"codedoc.html" file.
